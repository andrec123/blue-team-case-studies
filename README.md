# Incident Response & DFIR Case Studies

This repository contains investigation style writeups based on
hands on labs and simulated incidents from platforms such as
TryHackMe and CyberDefenders.

The focus is on:
- Incident detection and triage
- Evidence-based investigation
- Timeline reconstruction
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Response and mitigation recommendations

These reports are written to mirror real-world SOC and DFIR workflows.
